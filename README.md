## üìö Project overview

The aim of Kronometro is to integrate useful features to boost user productivity, to be more focused and more productive, including the Pomodoro¬Æ Technique and task management.

The Pomodoro¬Æ Technique is a time management method that break work, or study time, into intervals separated by short breaks. It was developed by Francesco Cirillo, and have been used by over 2 million people.

There are other open and closed-source applications that provide those same features, but only a few include both a nice User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) as the Kronometro does.

Also, Kronometro differentiates itself from similar projects by using modern technologies. Our source code was made using: the utility-first CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss); and the JavaScript framework [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).
